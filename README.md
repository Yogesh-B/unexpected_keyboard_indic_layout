# unexpected_keyboard_indic_layout
Mainly Hindi and Gujarati phonetic layouts inspired by linux/gnome Gujarati/Hindi phonetic layout


There is an online editor available for making it easy for creating layout(thanks in advance to the respective creatorðŸ™‚): https://unexpected-keyboard-layout-editor.lixquid.com/

 -- feel free to complete Gujarati phonetic with number rows(without separate numbers row, it looks crowded)
 -- feel free to add Hindi phonetic KaGaPa(a numbers row version also welcome)
